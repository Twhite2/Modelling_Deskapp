# Contributing to Overload
First of all, thanks for your interest into Overload! Any contribution is welcome:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Improving the code quality

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your branch from `develop` respecting naming conventions
3. Review your code before submitting (Build and quality check)
4. Create a pull request to `develop`

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Interfaces starts by `I`
* Abstracts starts by `A`
* Class names: `UpperCamelCase`
* Public member variables: `lowerCamelCase`
* Private member variables: `m_lowerCamelCase`
* Public static variables: `UpperCamelCase`
* Private static variables: `_CAPS_LOCK_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
* Function/Method arguments: `p_lowerCamelCase`
* Function/Method names: `UpperCamelCase`
* Class member variables are located on file bottom
* Comment your functions, enums, classes, methods ([Javadoc style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc))
Some coding convention could have been forget while redacting this document, so always refer to the existing code base!
